For example, let's assume an application has a "contact us" page that allows a user to supply contact information to t
he administrator in order to be contacted later.  Since the results of that data are only viewable by an administrator 
manually and not the requesting user and if the application was vulnerable to XSS, then the attacker would not immediately 
see their "alert(1)" attack.  In these cases, we can use XSSHunter (https://xsshunter.com) to help us validate the Blind XSS.

How XSSHunter works is that when our JavaScript payload executes, it will take a screenshot of the victim's screen 
(the current page they are viewing) and send that data back to the XSSHunter's site.  When this happens, XSSHunter will 
send an alert that our payload executed and provide us with all the detailed information.  We can now go back to create a 
very malicious payload and replay our attack. XSS Hunter: 

  Disable any Proxies (i.e. Burp Suite)
  Create account at https://xsshunter.com  
  Login at https://xsshunter.com/app  
  Go to Payloads to get your Payload  
  Modify the payload to fit your attack or build a Polyglot with it  
  Check XSS hunter to see the payload execution
